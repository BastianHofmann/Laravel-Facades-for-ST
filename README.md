# Laravel 4 Facades

This [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) package offers easy access to the Laravel 4 facades.

If you ever find yourself digging through the Laravel 4 source code in search of the code that is behind a Facade, look no further! This plugin provides easy access to all the Laravel 4 Facades through the Sublime Text Command Palette. You can access it by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + P` (Mac) and typing 'Facade', and  you will get a list of all the available Facades.

**Note**: *Some of the Facades in this package are specific to Laravel 4.1, so they might not work for you*
